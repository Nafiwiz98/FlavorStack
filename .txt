🧱 Phase 1: Project Architecture & Planning
🔹 Define the App’s Purpose
FlavorStack is a recipe-sharing platform where users can:
- Browse and search for recipes
- Submit their own with images
- Save favorites
- View full recipe details
🔹 Decide on the Stack
You’ll use the MERN stack:
- MongoDB Atlas for storing recipes and user data
- Express.js for backend API
- React for frontend UI
- Node.js to run the server
You’ll also use:
- Cloudinary for image hosting
- JWT for authentication
- Render + Vercel for deployment

🧩 Phase 2: Backend Design
🔹 Data Models
You’ll need two main models:
- User: stores login info, saved recipes
- Recipe: stores title, ingredients, instructions, image URL, tags, author
🔹 API Routes
Plan RESTful endpoints like:
- GET /recipes → fetch all
- POST /recipes → create new
- GET /recipes/:id → view one
- PATCH /recipes/:id → update
- DELETE /recipes/:id → remove
- POST /auth/login 
- POST /auth/register
🔹 Middleware
Use middleware for:
- Auth protection (JWT verification)
- File upload handling (Multer)
- Error handling and validation

🎨 Phase 3: Frontend Flow
🔹 Pages to Build
- Home: list of recipes
- Add Recipe: form with image upload
- Recipe Detail: full view of one recipe
- Login/Register: auth flow
- Profile: user’s saved and submitted recipes
🔹 State Management
Use React hooks and context to manage:
- Auth state
- Recipe data
- Form inputs
- Loading and error states
🔹 Routing
Use React Router for navigation:
- / → Home
- /add → Add Recipe
- /recipe/:id → Detail view
- /login and /register
- /profile

🖼️ Phase 4: Image Upload Strategy
You’ll use:
- Multer to intercept and store the image in memory
- Cloudinary to host the image and return a URL
- Save that URL in MongoDB with the recipe
This keeps your server stateless and scalable.

🔐 Phase 5: Authentication
Use JWT to:
- Register and log in users
- Protect routes like “Add Recipe”
- Store token in localStorage
- Decode token to get user info

🚀 Phase 6: Deployment Plan
- Backend → Render (auto-deploy from GitHub)
- Frontend → Vercel (optimized for React)
- Database → MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted)
- Image Hosting → Cloudinary (CDN-powered)
You’ll configure .env files, set up CORS, and test everything end-to-end.

🧠 Phase 7: Polish & Scale
Once the core app works:
- Add search and filtering
- Make it mobile-friendly
- Add user profiles and favorites
- Track views or likes
- Write a clean README and deploy
